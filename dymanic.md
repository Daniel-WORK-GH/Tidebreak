## Data
The player starts with no understanding of the world, while doing quests the player learns more mechanics, how to navigate the world, and how to fight.

- The game is set as a top down (isometric) 3rd person. 

## Player Controls
The user controls the player directly using the mouse & keyboard.
I picked this type of control because its my favorite and in my opinion most players prefer it.w

# Strategies
The Strategies are based mostly on how fast the player wants to finish the game, if the player is willing to replay mission so such. 
- Better strategy : Grind a bit to get better loop & more gold to make the rest of the game easier.
- Worse strategy : Rush the game as fast as possible.

User experience wise there isnt a better/worse strategy, each player can play however he enjoys.
